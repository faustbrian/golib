# Contributing

## Before Editing

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the affected module's goals and docs.
2. Run `make inventory` and the narrow baseline gate for the module.
3. Identify owned dependencies and reverse dependants in `modules.json`.
4. Preserve unrelated work and generated/corpus provenance.

## Changes

Keep commits focused and conventional. Update every affected changelog with
the behavior and migration impact. Public API changes require compatibility
evidence and documentation. Specification behavior requires a decision record,
fixture coverage, and interoperability evidence.

Do not add package-local workflows, permanent replacements, machine-specific
paths, bypass flags, broad mutation exclusions, or aggregate quality metrics
that hide a failing package.

## Verification

Run during development:

```bash
make inventory
make check MODULES=pkg/<library>
```

Before submitting a repository-wide change:

```bash
make ci-changed BASE=origin/main
```

The full scheduled and release gate is `make ci`. Report every unavailable or
failing command; do not describe partial results as release-ready.

## Adding A Module

Follow [module lifecycle procedures](docs/module-lifecycle.md). New modules
require an explicit purpose, ownership boundary, dependency review, package
catalog entry, full quality gates, documentation, changelog, license, security
policy, compatibility plan, and release dry-run.
