# Migration

From BoxPacker, `gopackx`, or `bp3d`, first normalize every dimension and mass
through `measurement`; do not copy numeric fields as if units already match.
Expand quantities into stable item instance IDs, map rotation policy to
physical-axis orientations, declare finite stock explicitly, and choose an
ordered objective instead of relying on implicit box order.

Treat old solver output as untrusted: translate it into a `knapsack.Plan` and
run `verify.Plan`. A heuristic failure is `best_known` or a work-limit result,
never proven infeasibility. Comparative tests must remove unsupported semantics
from both sides and compare solution validity and quality before runtime.
