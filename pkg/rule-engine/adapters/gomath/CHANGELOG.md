# Changelog

All notable changes to this module are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Distribution

- Include the canonical MIT licence in the independently published module.

### Compatibility

- Added a pinned module export baseline so incompatible public API changes
  fail the canonical repository gate.

### Changed

- Require owned sibling modules at local `v0.0.0`; clean external consumers
  pin each module to an exact main pseudo-version.

- Refresh owned-module checksums against the final consolidated archives.
- Normalized standalone module metadata against the canonical owned dependency
  graph, including complete checksums for clean consumer resolution.
- Documented the exported decimal operator-name contract.

### Added

- Add an allocation-aware benchmark for exact decimal operator evaluation.
- Add bounded fuzz coverage that cross-checks tagged decimal acceptance
  against the canonical decimal parser.
